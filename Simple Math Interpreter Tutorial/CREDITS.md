While this is my own project, I wanna state that this is a direct C++ translation of the "Simple Math Interpreter in Python" tutorial series by CodePulse.

As a Python developer initially, while watching the tutorial, I took it as a challenge to do everything the creator of the videos was doing, but translating it to C++. I ended learning a lot about C++ alongside parsing techniques. It was a very fun learning process and I was able to apply most of the knowledge form the video series into my main project.
